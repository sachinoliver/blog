## What is IAM?

In AWS `Identity and Access Management (IAM)` is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. You use IAM to control who is `authenticated (signed in)` and `authorized (has permissions)` to use resources.
It helps you set up users and groups, and shows you how to protect your resources with access control policies. It also shows how to connect to other identity services to grant external users access to your AWS resources.


## What are IAM Resources?

The `user`, `group`, `role`, `policy`, and `identity provider objects` that are stored in IAM. As with other AWS services, you can add, edit, and remove resources from IAM.
