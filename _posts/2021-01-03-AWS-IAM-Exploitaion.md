## What is IAM?

In AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources. It helps you set up users and groups, and shows you how to protect your resources with access control policies. It also shows how to connect to other identity services to grant external users access to your AWS resources.

So, a simple misconfiguration in IAM can lead to privilege escalation. which then can lead to furthur exploitations.
The IAM uses policy (JSON format) for assigning actions for the users which are attached to ceratin groups.
