## What is IAM?

In AWS `Identity and Access Management (IAM)` is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. You use IAM to control who is `authenticated (signed in)` and `authorized (has permissions)` to use resources.
It helps you set up users and groups, and shows you how to protect your resources with access control policies. It also shows how to connect to other identity services to grant external users access to your AWS resources.

So, a simple misconfiguration in IAM can lead to privilege escalation, which then can lead to furthur exploitations.

## Policies
The IAM uses policies (`JSON format`) for assigning actions for the users and roles which are attached to ceratin groups.
Services like `S3 bucket` for example have policy attached to them which allow users to do certain actions like listing bucket files or uploading files to the bucket etc.
Some services can have policies attached to them in the form of roles, that can be in the form of either a `service-linked roles`, where the service is granted to the role or having a role attached to a component in the service.
Policy is attached to a resource, such as a user account, EC2 instance, or internal AWS function, allowing that resource to make API calls to execute actions within the account. A policy that allows a user to retrieve objects from an S3 bucket may look like this:
```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "s3:GetObject"
  ],
  "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
  ]
}
